# Perdect Man

*“Perfect Man”* is a South Korean film directed by Yong Soo, which tells the story of Jang-su (played by Seol Kyung-gu), a middle-aged man diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). The film sensitively portrays his emotional journey as he faces the gradual breakdown of his body. ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in which motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord deteriorate over time, leading to muscle paralysis. As the disease advances, it affects speech, swallowing, and eventually breathing, while cognitive functions remain intact. This cruel progression not only causes intense physical suffering but also emotional isolation and despair, highlighting the devastating impact on patients and their families.

Through its narrative, "Perfect Man" challenges social stigma and raises awareness about ALS by portraying the lived experience of the patient and the emotional toll on his loved ones. The film encourages a compassionate view toward those suffering from incurable diseases, aiming to reduce misunderstanding and promote empathy.

[In the film *Perfect Man*, the music](https://youtu.be/Ps9Fcg8u7X0?si=nf2GGk-g--54y2Nb) effectively reflects the protagonist’s emotional transformation as his illness progresses. Composer Jang Young-gyu conveys this painful reality and emotional turbulence through a poignant, orchestral-based score. The music mirrors Jang-su’s psychological shifts, enhancing the narrative without overshadowing it. For example, when Jang-su receives his terminal diagnosis and gazes silently out of the hospital window, the subdued piano melody combined with sustained strings evokes his shock, loss, and solitude powerfully and wordlessly. Conversely, in a scene where he visits the seaside with a friend despite his deteriorating condition, the music becomes warmer and more uplifting. The bright piano theme paired with gentle strings highlights the enduring value of human connection and fleeting hope amid despair.
Jang Young-gyu’s score serves as an emotional narrator, expressing not only the pain and fear of ALS but also the resilience and dignity found in hope. It reflects the silent internal battle of living with a degenerative disease, making the audience deeply feel the protagonist’s journey beyond physical symptoms.

The 2014 film [*”The Theory of Everything”*](zhang_yuwei.md) also portrays ALS, focusing on the life of physicist Stephen Hawking. Both *“Perfect Man”* and *“The Theory of Everything”* use music—primarily piano and string instruments—to convey the emotional complexities of ALS patients. However, while "The Theory of Everything" features a more classical and subtle score that reflects intellectual resilience and personal triumph, *"Perfect Man"* employs a more raw, orchestral sound that emphasizes emotional vulnerability and social isolation. Both scores successfully intertwine despair and hope, but *“Perfect Man”* leans into a somber, introspective tone, whereas *“The Theory of Everything”* occasionally incorporates moments of lightness and optimism through its musical themes. This comparison highlights different cultural and narrative approaches to the same disease and enriches our understanding of how music can shape audience empathy.

## 장례식에서 틀고 싶은 노래: [검정치마 – Love Shine](https://youtu.be/33tF2FBDJGI?si=xcTHz9zUSPKRBAYR)
이 노래는 이별노래이자 사랑노래 입니다. 조용하고 따뜻한 분위기로, 사랑했던 사람들과 순간들을 담담하게 떠올리게 해줍니다.

사는 동안 많은 고마움과 행복을 느꼈고, 그 마음을 전하고 싶습니다. 저는 원없이 잘 살았으니 너무 걱정하지 말고, 남은 분들도 행복하게 지내길 바랍니다. 또 언젠가 다시 함께 행복한 시간을 보낼 수 있을 거라는 믿음도 가지고 있습니다.

이 노래가 그런 저의 마지막 마음을 잘 전달해줄 것 같아 선택했습니다.
