# Notre-Dame de Paris

 In the song [*Dieu que le monde est injuste*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puzRBbqC1qI), Quasimodo—a man condemned to solitude and scorn because of his physical deformity—emerges as a deeply human and tragic figure, full of hidden tenderness and pain. Despite his grotesque exterior, he possesses a pure heart and a desperate yearning to be loved and seen as equal.
 
 The refrain “Ah ! Dieu ! que le monde est injuste” (“Ah, God, how unfair the world is”) expresses Quasimodo’s outcry against the injustice he faces due to his physical disability. As a recurring line, it forms the emotional core of the piece. The phrase “Mon visage est un masque” (“My face is a mask”), which appears in the middle of the first verse, symbolizes the pain of having to hide his true self because of his grotesque appearance. “Je me sens seul” (“I feel alone”), found in the second verse or the bridge, reveals Quasimodo’s deep sense of isolation. The line “Pourquoi faut-il que je souffre ainsi ?” (“Why must I suffer like this?”), which appears just before the climax, highlights the anguish of a person whose very existence is denied.

 On stage, the actor portraying Quasimodo uses a hunched posture, twisted gait, and withdrawn movements to represent his physical pain. A rough and coarse voice is used to depict his external affliction, while a soft and expressive singing tone contrasts this by conveying his inner purity. The music begins softly and gradually intensifies, expanding Quasimodo’s suffering beyond physical pain into a broader expression of protest against injustice. At the climax, the despair of being denied as a human being and the suppressed longing erupt powerfully, effectively communicating Quasimodo’s pain to the audience.

A similar disease, ALS, is described in the film [*The Theory of Everything*](kim_minju.md). The disease is portrayed through Die Walküre Act 1 – Vorspiel and Götterdämmerung – Siegfried’s Death and Funeral Music.

# John Lennon - Love

The song I would like to be played at my funeral is [*"Love" by John Lennon*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUTz3LQEq1Q&list=RDMUTz3LQEq1Q&start_radio=1). It’s not my favorite song, but it’s the one I most want to share with others. That’s because its lyrics are deeply meaningful to me. There’s no elaborate language or grand statements—just a quiet, simple repetition that, to me, gently holds the essence of love. I hope that those attending my funeral will listen to this song and go on to live their days with a little more love in their hearts.

# 질환서사

*가상인물입니다.

나는 다섯째, 네 명의 누나 사이에서 자랐다. 부모님은 늘 바빴고, 나는 누나들 품에서 크는 아이였다. 어렸을 때 난 소아 당뇨 진단을 받았다. 달달한 걸 좋아하던 나는, 어느 날부터 매 끼니마다 혈당을 재고 주사를 맞아야 했다. 그런데 이상하게도, 슬프지 않았다. 누나들이 내 곁에 있었기 때문이다.

큰누나는 보리밥을 지어주며 “막내는 우리 보물”이라 했고, 둘째 누나는 주사약을 늘 가장 안전하게 챙겨뒀다. 셋째는 “인슐린은 친구야~” 같은 노래를 불러줬고, 막내 누나는 내 그림자처럼 어디든 따라다녔다. 누나들은 그저 나를 돌본 게 아니라, 내 병을 함께 살아줬다. 당뇨는 내 몸에 오래 머물렀지만, 그 시간은 아픔보다 따뜻함으로 더 또렷하다. 내가 버틴 건 의학 덕분만이 아니다. 그 시절, 누나들의 손이 나를 살렸다.
