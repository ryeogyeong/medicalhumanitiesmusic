# Keys to the Heart (그것만이 내 세상)

In this film, the protagonist, Intae, has savant syndrome. Savant syndrome refers to a condition in which individuals with brain impairments exhibit extraordinary abilities in specific areas. Intae possesses a genius-level talent for the piano. At the Frederic Gala Concert, he delivers a brilliant performance of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1. Before he sits at the piano, people laugh at him or whisper behind his back. But the moment he begins to play, everyone's attention is drawn to him. His powerful performance earns a standing ovation and thunderous applause from the audience. 

Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 begins with a bold, dramatic theme that commands attention and evokes a sense of grandeur and defiance. The concerto is known for its virtuosic demands, intense emotional contrasts, and triumphant climaxes. This performance serves as a powerful symbolic moment that shatters the prejudice of those who had judged him based solely on his appearance before hearing him play.

I thought this work was similar to mine because it also showed how music is used in a story about overcoming and growing. Mamoru Hosoda's 2021 musical [*Belle : The Dragon and the Freckled Princess](huh_yejin.md).

# 장례식에서 연주되었으면 하는 노래

I think I’d play Toy’s “[A Farewell to Remember(뜨거운 안녕)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBRZzsO3L3o)” at my funeral.
Because I only want people who were truly close to me to be there—
and I don’t want them to be sad.
I hope they can just let go, coolly, and return to their own lives.
The lyrics say goodbye, but the melody isn’t gloomy.
I think that’s the kind of temperature I want in my relationships with people.

# 작성자의 질환서사

저는 척추측만증이 조금 심한 편입니다. 육안으로도 확연하게 보이고, 어릴 때는 수술 얘기까지 나왔지만 일단은 보류한 채 지내고 있습니다. 평소에는 괜찮지만 오래 앉아 있으면 조금 뻐근하긴 합니다. 그러다가 재작년 밤에 갑자기 너무 아파서 눕지도 앉지도 서지도 못했던 적이 있었는데, 진통제를 서너 알씩 먹으면서 다시는 다리도 안 꼬고 옆으로 눕지도 않을 테니 제발 통증이 가셨으면 좋겠다고 빌었습니다. 밤새 병원이 문을 열기만을 기다리면서, 불안함을 달래려 밤새 일부러 템포가 빠른 애니 오프닝들을 들었는데, 이 플레이리스트입니다[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf8KpqX4fmV0a41nFvTT0as_4QBYQM2Um&si=YjsQmsX95d7ohhsx].
