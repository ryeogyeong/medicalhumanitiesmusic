# The_end_of_the_f***ing_world

In The End of the F***ing World (2017-2018), created by Jonathan Entwistle and based on the graphic novel by Charles Forsman, music plays a subtle yet emotionally resonant role, revealing the inner lives of two troubled teenagers who struggle to express themselves. The series blends dark humor and existential loneliness through the story of James (Alex Lawther), a boy who believes he’s a psychopath, and Alyssa (Jessica Barden), a rebellious girl desperate to escape her home life. James’s emotional numbness appears to stem from childhood neglect and a distant relationship with his father, forming the psychological basis for his dissociation from others. Similarly, Alyssa’s defiance and emotional volatility reflect her response to neglect and distrust in her own family.

One striking example of this emotional layering occurs with the use of Graham Coxon’s [“Walking All Day.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FruHLslczag) The song plays during a quiet moment between the two characters, allowing the viewer to feel the weight of unspoken thoughts and the tenderness that words fail to convey. The track’s melancholic tone and sparse instrumentation mirror James’s internal shift—from numb detachment to a fragile recognition of connection and care. Its slow tempo, repetitive acoustic guitar pattern, and absence of percussive rhythm evoke a sense of stasis and psychological isolation, mirroring James’s emotional paralysis. In this context, music becomes not just background, but a voice for the emotional truths the characters themselves are unable to articulate. This emotional emptiness is central to Antisocial Personality Disorder, and the minimalistic structure of the music reflects James’s inability to access or express deeper emotions. The lyric “I’ve been walking all day” becomes symbolic of James’s emotional journey—silent, aimless, and longing for connection he cannot name.

The same disease Antisocial personality disorder is described in Lynne Ramsay's 2011 film [*We Need to Talk About Kevin*](han_yeonsoo.md). The music used in the film is Buddy Holly's "Everyday", and it similarly conveys the protagonist’s antisocial traits and emotional coldness through its use. Another shared aspect is that the protagonist is a minor, and their antisocial traits are shown to be connected to their parents.

The song I would like to be played at my funeral is ["LOVE (Variation 2)"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74VQee_Dc3k&list=PLRW80bBvVD3X5f66klHCVs3Y-D_Aio9-d&index=6), composed by Lia Ouyang Rusli, from the soundtrack of the film *Happy End*. This track features a minimalist piano melody that repeats and slowly evolves, carrying with it emotions that are hard to put into words. It doesn’t try to overwhelm the listener but instead approaches quietly, with restraint, which makes it all the more moving. The flow of the music feels like a gentle reflection on a long life, and the fading notes toward the end leave a lingering sense of calm. I hope my funeral isn’t a time of overwhelming sorrow, but rather a quiet and peaceful moment of remembrance. I believe this music fits that atmosphere well—it allows people to remember me in their own way, not with too much sadness, but with a calm farewell.

A는 섭식장애를 앓고 있다. 어릴 적부터 발레를 해왔고, 배고픔을 무시하거나 아픈 걸 참는 데 익숙했다. 먹으면 몸이 무거워지고 동작이 흐려진다는 감각은 자연스럽게 식사를 경계하게 만들었고, 시간이 흐르면서 점점 감정과 연결되기 시작했다. 특히 누군가 앞에서 음식을 먹는 상황이 불편해졌고, 먹는 모습이 보일 때마다 자신의 불안을 들키는 듯한 기분이 들었다. 그런 긴장감과 괴로움을 피하려다 보니 식사를 줄이게 되었고, 어느새 먹지 않는 것이 감정을 정리하는 방식이 되어 자신을 지키는 일종의 방어처럼 굳어졌다. 시간이 흐르면서 허기보다 안도감, 식욕보다는 공허함, 식사 후의 포만감보다는 식사 전의 통제감이 더 익숙해졌다. 무엇보다 배가 고프면, 그 고통 덕분에 외로움이나 슬픔, 불안 같은 감정들을 생각하지 않아도 되는 것 같았다. 말하지 않으면 병도 감정도 없는 것처럼 느껴졌다. 그러다 어느 날, 연습이 끝난 뒤 탈의실에 혼자 남아 있다가 문득 거울 속 자신을 오래 바라보게 되었다. 그 순간 어떤 확신이 든 건 아니었지만, 지금의 상태가 조금 이상하다는 생각은 분명했다. 그날 이후로 A는 식사를 전보다 더 천천히, 조심스럽게 대하며 조금씩 먹기 시작했다. 크게 달라진 건 없지만, 지금 자신의 상태가 괜찮지 않을 수도 있다는 생각을 처음으로 받아들이게 되었다.
