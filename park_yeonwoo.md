# The Fall

[Beethoven's *Symphony No. 7, 2nd movement*](https://youtu.be/Urv9aruTups?si=SoZgX20_iMUX2C_B) symbolizes his physical disability and helplessness through its slow, repetitive rhythms. He composed this piece after becoming almost completely deaf—a devastating loss that plunged him into isolation and despair. The mournful rhythm reflects the weight of his condition, while the haunting melodies express the emotional turbulence of losing a core part of his identity. Yet within the melancholy, there is also a sense of defiance and a yearning for transcendence. 
Similarly, in The Fall, the protagonist Roy is a stuntman who suffers a spinal injury that leaves him paralyzed from the waist down. Once full of vitality and purpose, he is now bedridden and emotionally broken, struggling with the loss of control over his life and body. His helplessness is not only physical but deeply psychological—he feels abandoned, purposeless, and suicidal. The music mirrors his inner turmoil: the slow tempo captures the stagnation of his present life, while the crescendos evoke the emotional storms he endures. Roy’s elaborate fantasy stories, told to a young girl named Alexandria, serve as both an escape from reality and a subconscious path toward healing. 
Through Beethoven’s music, the film powerfully underscores Roy’s suffering and his desire to reclaim agency in a seemingly hopeless life. His disability is portrayed not just as a medical condition, but as a profound emotional and existential crisis. Ultimately, the music becomes the voice of his silent struggle—a journey through despair, imagination, and the fragile hope of recovery.

Example: The similar disease(paralysis) is described in Olivier Nakache 2011 film [*The Intouchables*](kim_naeun.md). The piano music *'Una Martina'* of "The Intouchables" depicts the protagonist's physical disability in three dimensions, similar to the symphony of "The Fall". Both songs have similar atmospheres that reveal the bitter and empty heart of the protagonist and at the same time give hope in the heart.

# 내 장례식에 연주되길 희망하는 노래

내 장례식에는 도시(dosii)의 ‘lovememore.’이라는 노래가 연주되었으면 좋겠다. 이 노래는 내가 살아오면서 가장 많이 들은 곡이고, 가사와 분위기에는 장례식에 와줄 이들에게 전하고 싶은 내 마음이 담겨 있다. 비록 나는 이제 세상에서 사라졌지만, 지금 이 순간만큼은 나를 기억하고, 한 번만 더 바라봐 주길 바란다. ‘lovememore.’은 그런 내 마지막 바람을 조용히 대신 전해주는 노래다.
