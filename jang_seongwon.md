# Nymphomaniac

In the film Nymphomaniac, the story is about a woman named 'Joe.' After she is found hurt, she tells her life story to 'Seligman,' the man who rescued her. Whenever Joe tells a story, Seligman keeps trying to annotate it with his knowledge of things like fishing, mathematics, psychology or music. Their talk becomes a kind of smart argument, like a game of ping-pong: Joe shares her feelings, and Seligman replies with his logical ideas.

In [chapter 5 The Little Organ School](https://youtu.be/dIvuZ1bmrWs?si=IfHkbCZW3tDC15q7), Seligman starts the conversation with, “It's something I've been listening to a lot lately.” and introduces Bach’s chorale prelude <Ich ruf zu Dir, Herr Jesu Christ>. “This piece has three voices: the bass voice, the second voice played with the left hand, and first voice played with the right hand. (…) And together, these three voices create the polyphony.”
Joe immediately maps her nymphomaniac experience onto this musical form. “Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as... someone who can't get enough, and therefore, has sex with many different people. Well, that, of course, is true, but if I'm to be honest, I see it precisely as the sum of all these different sexual experiences. So in that way, I have only one lover.”

An intellectually elegant metaphor seems to be born. The film supports Joe's claim with a seductive formalism. She maps her partner F, the "monotonous foundation," to the bass line. G, the "unpredictable" partner, is assigned to the alto line. Jerome, who was "love," corresponds to the brilliant soprano. These three melodies are finally integrated into a perfect ensemble within a [split-screen montage(**Includes sexual content**)](https://vimeo.com/1036892452?share=copy). In this moment, her argument appears audiovisually complete.

Yet, this elegant metaphor falls apart when faced with the evidence she herself provides. True polyphony is a harmony of unique, irreplaceable voices. Joe’s partners, in contrast, are reduced to anonymous initials like 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F', 'G', 'H' and 'K'. Beyond these figures, there are many more partners who pass in and out of her without even a name or any identifying mark. Their lack of identity—whether through initials or absence of them—exposes them as nothing more than entities fulfilling a role. They are treated as functional parts, replaceable rather than as unique individuals. This dehumanization proves the history of her body's failure to achieve satisfaction and intimacy. A true 'ensemble' cannot be built from non-unique parts. Faced with this contradiction, the beautiful narrative constructed by the mind can no longer be defended.

The fact that this inherently flawed metaphor is directed with such aesthetic perfection gives rise to irony, and the power of this scene comes from that ironic failure. The sublime music does not save the chaotic life. It functions as a cynical mirror that reflects its emptiness. Yet, what is revealed at the end of this deconstruction is not mere cynicism, but a truth of a deeper dimension. It is not the 'perfect harmony' Joe intended to show. Instead, it is the more honest truth that her self is constituted by 'the sum of all failed relationships.' In the end, this 'failed ensemble' becomes a paradoxical portrait, recording a wounded human existence—one where relationships remain abstract and never touch the Real—more truthfully than the beautiful lie of a perfect harmony ever could.

<img src="./jang_seongwon_img.png" alt="This image visualizes a structure of self-alienation disguised as a harmony of pleasure, revealing a state in which Joe’s body is ultimately denied the possibility of becoming “a person.” Her body is fragmented into pieces, forming an illusion of wholeness while in fact representing the absence of any real totality. The silhouettes in the background can be read as anonymized proxies of her past partners—traces of the gazes that consumed her body—symbolizing a structure where intimacy is replaced by abstracted desire." style="width:35%;" />

In musical Notre-Dame de Paris, Quasimodo’s body crystallises into one grotesque mass, so [*hyper-visible*](kim_hyoju.md) that every gaze must collide with its “monstrous” excess. Joe’s body, by contrast, scatters into erotic shards—encountered by herself and by others only as isolated acts or organs—so that no coherent figure ever comes into focus. One body is oppressively present, pinned to a single outline; the other is perpetually absent, encountered only in fragments that refuse to add up to a person. Together they trace the two poles of deviant embodiment.

# [별 (이병기 시 / 윤학준 곡)](https://youtu.be/KvndHb9Zgqw?feature=shared)

죽음은 남겨진 이들의 삶을 아프게 짓누른다. 그 깊은 침묵과 슬픔 속에서 헤어나오는 것은 언제나 어려운 일이다. 하지만 산 사람은 죽음의 시간에만 갇혀 있을 수 없다. 그들은, 본래 그들이 있던 자리로 돌아가야 한다. 나는 <별>이 그 막막한 귀환을 위한 다정한 이정표가 되길 바란다.

**바람이 서늘도 하여 뜰 앞에 나섰더니 서산머리에 하늘은 구름을 벗어나고 / 산뜻한 초사흘달이 별 함께 나오더라**  
땅에 묶였던 시선은 자연스레 하늘로 향한다. 억지로 끌어올린 시선이 아니다. 서늘한 바람을 느끼고 고개를 들어보니 그곳에 달과 별이 떠 있는, 지극히 자연스러운 흐름이다. 죽음이 주는 수직적 무게감에서 벗어나 아득하고 평화로운 지상 너머로 시선이 부드럽게 이동하는 것이다.

**달은 넘어가고 별만 서로 반짝인다**  
내 삶은 이제 서산 너머로 졌다. 하지만 세상은 끝나지 않았다. 달이 사라진 하늘에서 오히려 더 선명하게 빛나는 별들이 보인다. 남겨진 사람들, 그들 각자의 삶이 저마다의 빛으로 반짝이는 모습이다.

**저 별은 뉘 별이며 내 별 또 어느 게요 / 잠자코 호올로 서서 별을 헤어 보노라**  
별을 헤아리는 행위는 오직 살아있는 자만이 누릴 수 있는 특권이다. 그것은 계속해서 반짝여야 할 자기 삶의 자리를 되묻는 일이기도 하다. 이 질문은 남겨진 이들을 슬픔에서 벗어나게 한다. 그리고 마침내 삶으로 귀환하는 길로 그들을 이끌 것이다.

그래서 이 음악은 장례식이 끝난 순간에 진짜 시작된다. 장례식에서 연주될 때는 그저 아름다운 위로일 뿐이다. 하지만 며칠 몇 달이 지난 어느 날 밤, 무심코 올려다본 하늘에서 별을 발견한 누군가가 서늘한 바람 속에서 이 노래를 기억해낼 때, 그때 비로소 음악은 그 사람의 마음속에서 완성될 것이다.
