# Cheongseol(Hear Me)

 The film Cheongseol portrays hearing impairment not as a deficiency, but as an expansion of perception—a concept often referred to as Deaf Gain, [with the song "Four Season"](https://youtu.be/PO6VyzBZWcI?si=W61sXzlxYA1ndZGV). Rather than focusing on what is lost, the film highlights how silence can awaken a deeper emotional sensitivity and richer forms of interpersonal connection. The main theme song, Season (Gyejeol), sung by No Yoon-seo and her younger sister—both portrayed as hearing-impaired—serves as a key emotional bridge. Its soft piano melody and gradually
 layered strings trace an emotional arc that mirrors the evolving relationship between the sisters: their shared loneliness, a yearning for conection, a quiet affection, and an unspoken but powerful understanding. One espeacially moving scene unfolds in a sunlit room where the sisters, seated across from each other, communicate solely through facial expressions, touch, and rhythm. There are no words, only Season playing gently in the background. In that stillness, a subtle shift occurs: a timid glance becomes a smile, a hand resting on another's signals trust. Through these gestures, the music becomes their shared voice-translating silence into intimacy. The piece doesn't merely accompany the film: it speaks for it, turning absence of sound into a powerful form of expression. In doing so, Season affirms that emotional truth does not depend on hearing, and that silence is not emptiness but a space where other forms of meaning can emerge. Cheongseol invites the audience into a world where human connection blooms not in speech, but in stillness, light, and resoncance. 

Example: The same disease is described in Sian Heder's 2021 film [*CODA*](han_gahyeon.md). The film contains Joni mitchell's song "Both sides now".

If I were to choose one song to be played at my funeral, it would be ["You Are My Star" by Lee Woo](https://youtu.be/XmMM8XVsZXw?si=76X6LswEBEKw8EKd). The lyrics-"You are my star, my happiness, my gift"-carry a quiet yet powerful sentiment. They speak not only of affection, but of gratitude and presence. I chose this song because I hope, in some way, my life was just that to someone - a small light, a source of warmth, a meaningful gift.
Rather than a farewell heavy with sorrow, I would want this moment to feel like a hentle thank-you - a final reminder that love, however fleeting, leaves behind something lasting. This song captures that feeling with simplicity and grace.
