# Navillera

In Navillera, [Taemin’s “My Day” is more than just a song about chasing a dream](https://youtu.be/Uj0q9fOmSD8?si=INpZq44ExPPAVPTg) — it quietly embraces the struggles of two people standing at different crossroads of life. For Deok-chul Sim, it becomes a warm light as he dares to revive a long-forgotten dream in the face of fading memories. For Chae-rok Lee, burdened by the uncertainty of his future, it echoes the quiet hopes he tries so hard to hold onto. As “My Day” gently flows through the story, it captures the shared longing of both characters: to keep walking toward something meaningful, even when the road ahead is blurred. The line, “Dream my dream, so that I can reach wherever, whatever,” becomes an encouragement for both the old man chasing a final wish and the young dancer struggling to find his path. In moments when life feels heavy and unsure, My Day wraps around them like sunlight, reminding them that it’s not too late to dream again.
The song’s gentle, hopeful tone contrasts with the gravity of his diagnosis, offering a sense of light and continuity despite cognitive decline. This contrast helps convey the emotional reality of living with Alzheimer’s—not just loss, but also the quiet resilience to keep dreaming. The song is notably used in scenes where Deok-chul shares quiet, joyful moments with Chae-rok during ballet practice, representing a space where illness momentarily recedes and connection takes over. It also plays during a rooftop conversation where Deok-chul admits his fear of forgetting, and Chae-rok promises to help him remember through dance.

Though the disease discussed is not the same as [*Keys to the Heart*](SeHyun-Moon.md), both explore how music functions as a medium of emotional expression beyond verbal communication. While Sim Deok-chul in *Navillera* uses dance and music to rekindle a dream that illness threatens to extinguish, Jin-tae in *Keys to the Heart* expresses his inner life through piano, despite his difficulty with verbal communication. Both characters find in music a space where they are free from the limitations imposed by their conditions.

# 장례식에서 나오길 바라는 음악
[꽃이 피고 지듯이](https://youtu.be/y-sqDi4cgdI?si=ImhjvioAzq1LesxR). I want this song to be played at my funeral because it expresses everything I would want to say to the people I leave behind — with both honesty and grace. The lyrics quietly accept the end of life as a part of nature, with lines like “I leave behind my pain” and “like flowers bloom and fall,” which help reframe death not as a tragedy, but as a soft farewell. What makes this song particularly meaningful to me is how it captures both apology and love. The line “If a trace of my warmth still remains in your heart, touch my face once before the wind scatters” feels like a last, gentle request for remembrance — not grand or desperate, but human. Musically, the melody is tender and reflective, never overwhelming, which I feel would create a moment of peace for the listeners. This song doesn’t try to erase sorrow — instead, it embraces it softly, and that’s exactly the kind of goodbye I would hope for.

# 질병/질환 서사와 플레이리스트
김도혁은 군 복무 중 가장 사랑했던 할머니가 세상을 떠났다는 소식을 들었다. 평소 도윤에게 할머니는 부모처럼 든든한 존재였다. 갑작스러운 이별로 인해 깊은 충격에 빠지게 되었다. 전역 이후에도 다른 일들이 겹쳐 우울증에 빠지게 되었다. 유난히 붐비는 퇴근길 지하철, 복잡한 거리, 같은 상황 속에 있을 때는 그저 집에 돌아가고 싶은 마음부터 들었다. 사람을 피했고, 마음을 닫았다. 누구에게도 마음을 내보이기 어려웠고, 도은 스스로가 조금씩 무너지고 있다는 걸 느꼈다.

하지만 시간이 지나면서 그 상황에 계속 빠져있다고 해서 해결되는 것이 아니라는 것을 알게 되었다. 그리고 그 깨달음을 얻게 된 과정 속에서 중요한 역할을 한 것은 그가 우연히 들었던 노래들이다. [그 노래들](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKtcwSYLDr8&list=PLzDIrf9oqAcH8GAQGKqzBwruXo1UA8o3k)의 가사를 읽으면서 이별의 슬픔도 다시 되새김하면서도 자신의 꿈을 향해 이제 잊고 앞으로 나아가기로 결심했다.
