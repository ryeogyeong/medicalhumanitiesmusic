# Rain Man

People with autism are known to find a sense of stability through consistent routines and repetition. Although their behavior may appear chaotic or somewhat erratic to outside observers, they operate according to their own internal rules and structure. In the movie Rain Man, [This piece of music(Leaving Wallbrook-On the Road)](https://youtu.be/gEX3bBjz44s?si=VR_Zktla-0bqEbfv) appears in the scene where the protagonist, Charlie, leaves the Wallbrook institution and sets off on a journey with his brother, Raymond. The simple and repetitive melody musically expresses the repetitive and compulsive behaviors experienced by Charlie, who has autism, serving as a device that provides psychological comfort to the protagonist.

The music mainly features piano, soft synthesizers, with occasional acoustic guitar and flute, characterized by a slow and repetitive tempo. The simple, repeating melody combined with steady rhythms and gentle harmonies conveys a sense of psychological stability and comfort amid Charlie’s inner turmoil. The soft flute melodies and warm tones of the acoustic guitar add warmth to the music, delivering a sense of calm and solace that resonates with the audience, reflecting the comfort found in repetitive routines.

A drama that deals with the same disability is [*Extraordinary Attorney Woo*](kim_jaehee.md) Just as Rain Man has a genius-level ability with numbers, Woo Young-woo excels as a lawyer due to her incredible memorization skills. The music titled "Imagination" from this drama beautifully captures the clear and blue imagination that Woo Young-woo possesses.

### 내가 남기고 싶은 마지막 한 곡,

저의 장례식을 상상해 보면, 제 부재에 대한 슬픔보다는 저와 함께한 행복한 추억들이 떠올라, 눈물과 미소가 함께 어우러지는 공간이 되었으면 합니다.
그렇기에 제 장례식장에는 고요한 적막이나 전형적인 찬송가 대신, **Chopin Piano Concerto No.2, 2악장**이 흘러나왔으면 합니다.

이 곡은 제가 음악을 공부하며 만난 수많은 작품 중 가장 아름다운 곡 중 하나입니다. 쇼팽이 짝사랑하던 사람을 떠올리며 작곡했다고 전해지는데, 그래서인지 이 음악을 들을 때마다 설렘과 애틋한 그리움, 그리고 따뜻한 행복함을 느낄 수 있었습니다.

저의 마지막을 만나러 오시는 분들이, 이 곡을 들으며 제가 느꼈던 감정들을 조금이나마 함께 느끼며 저를 추억해 주셨으면 합니다.
