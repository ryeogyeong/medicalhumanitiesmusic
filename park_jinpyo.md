# Beethoven Virus


Beethoven Virus (2008, MBC) is a South Korean television drama centered on music. The story follows Kang Mae (played by Ji Jin-hee), a perfectionist conductor, as he clashes and harmonizes with various amateur musicians. The drama portrays characters who experience physical or psychological illnesses or disabilities, using music as a lens to explore their internal struggles and healing.

The similar condition, psychological trauma, is explored in Shin Bomin’s analysis of David O. Russell’s 2012 film [*Silver Linings Playbook*](shin_bomin.md). The protagonist, who suffers from bipolar disorder, experiences intense emotional responses triggered by music—specifically, My Cherie Amour by Stevie Wonder. This reflects how certain sounds can evoke suppressed emotional pain.

Likewise, [Beethoven Virus portrays characters dealing with hearing loss and deep psychological wounds.](https://youtu.be/cep8Ru4TL4k?si=RJ6CZzAS0lDtlUtG) Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9 acts as a powerful emotional medium, helping the characters confront their inner turmoil and find healing through music. Both works highlight how music can uncover buried trauma and serve as a path toward emotional restoration.

# 나의 장례식에서 연주되길 희망하는 음악
[Travis Scott - FE!N ft. Playboi Carti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9synWjqBn8):"FE!N"은 무거운 슬픔에 잠기기보다, 생전의 나를 강렬하게 기억해달라는 의지가 담긴 곡입니다. 반복되는 비트와 폭발적인 에너지는 단순한 추모를 넘어 삶에 대한 강렬한 존재감, 나만의 리듬으로 살아온 흔적을 강조하죠. 조용한 슬픔이 아닌, 내가 어떤 사람이었는지를 잊지 말고 기억해달라는 메시지를 담고 싶었습니다.
