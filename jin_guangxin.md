# A Silent Voice

Ani to Koe no Katachi (2016, directed by Naoko Yamada) is a poignant exploration of hearing impairment through the story of Shōko Nishimiya, a teenage girl navigating isolation and societal prejudice as her hearing gradually deteriorates. The film transcends mere disability representation by interweaving sensory dissonance with existential themes of human connection. Using innovative visual techniques—such as muted soundscapes and distorted close-ups—and minimalist sound design, it immerses viewers in Shōko’s fragmented perception of the world. A critique of societal indifference toward "invisible" disabilities, the narrative evolves into a meditation on empathy, communication, and the fragility of human bonds, elevated by the aesthetic sensibilities of Japanese art-house cinema.


Composed by Ken’ichi Nishio,[the electronic score lit](https://youtu.be/a57-KveTE84?si=t51QHNqHoZQroGCl) serves as both a narrative device and emotional anchor. The track juxtaposes glitchy digital textures with organic melodies, mirroring Shōko’s fluctuating auditory experiences. Irregular rhythms and distorted frequencies evoke the disorientation of hearing loss, while sudden silences amplify the void left by silenced voices. A standout moment reinterprets a traditional Japanese folk melody through fragmented graphic equalization, symbolizing the clash between tradition and modernity in disability discourse. Nishio’s score transcends ambiance—it becomes a protagonist itself, translating sensory absence into visceral sonic poetry. By blurring boundaries between diegetic and non-diegetic sound, the music challenges listeners to confront their own perceptual biases, aligning with the film’s thesis on empathy as a bridge between sensory worlds.

The same disease is described in Sian Heder's 20121 film [*Coda*](yu_taehee.md). The film Joni Mitchell's hit song "Both Sides Now".

[Kenya Grace's "Only In My Mind](https://youtu.be/tqpqOzuRSks?si=NJSzV9NSQELlMWb5)" is an emotionally charged electro-pop track that revolves around themes of memory, love, and loss, expressing how connections between people continue in memory. The lyrics repeatedly mention "only in my mind," suggesting that things that are gone may no longer exist in reality, but they are always alive in memory. This sentiment fits the mood of a funeral—we can't bring back the lives of the dead, but their presence will live on in the hearts of those who loved them.

The melody of the song is gentle and deep, and the lyrics express the nostalgia and relief for the past. It is like a gentle farewell, allowing those attending the funeral to feel the peace of the deceased and their gratitude for them. I chose Kenya Grace's "Only In My Mind" as the music for the funeral because the song, with its soft and deep melody and the theme of memory and loss, perfectly expresses the meaning of love and memory that life is gone but love and memory are forever. The "only in my mind" in the lyrics symbolizes that the deceased has left but will always live in the hearts of relatives and friends. At the same time, the modern sense of the song also reflects personal taste and style. It brings peace and healing in sadness, allowing people to find the continuation of emotions in remembrance. It is a gentle and powerful farewell song.
