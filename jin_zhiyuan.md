# Hilary and Jackie

In the movie, Elgar's Cello Concerto is used to express Jacqueline Dupre's emotions and her struggle with illness. As her multiple sclerosis worsened, this music became a symbol of her inner struggle and loneliness. It not only showcases her talent and passion as a musician, but also reflects her deep pain and helplessness in losing her abilities and undergoing life-changing changes. The sadness and reflection in the music deepen the film's emotional depth, reinforcing themes of loss and helplessness.

n Hilary and Jackie, music is not merely a background element but a powerful embodiment of emotion,[with Edward Elgar’s Cello Concerto serving as the emotional core of the film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1AL95ZjTAk); its somber, aching melodies, fractured rhythms, and shifting atmosphere vividly reflect the characters’ internal turmoil and evolving relationships—at times flowing freely to represent Jackie’s brilliance and control as a performer, and at other times breaking apart to mirror the devastating progression of multiple sclerosis, which slowly strips her of her physical abilities and identity; when she can no longer play, the absence of music becomes even more poignant, highlighting the profound loss and collapse of self, making music in the film not only a link between the sisters, but also Jackie’s voice of resistance against her fate and a deeply resonant force that intensifies the emotional impact of the story.

Example:In Hilary and Jackie and [*A Beautiful Mind*](pyo_sujin.md), both protagonists face diseases that slowly strip away control—MS attacks the body, while schizophrenia distorts the mind. Yet both suffer from isolation, unpredictable behavior, and a deepening loss of self. The cello and mathematics become their anchors—ways to make sense of chaos. Despite different symptoms, both illnesses blur the line between who they are and what the disease makes them become.

＃장례식 음악

At various stages of life, most of us cannot make our own decisions, but at least in our moments of death, I hope to decide what impression my departure will leave on those who care about me. I don't want it to evoke sadness or sorrow, which is why I chose [this song](https://youtu.be/TMQeYF_xOxE?si=ZBCWe9CDcrbU2K55).

＃질환서사：아서 모건의 마지막 여정

Arthur Morgan wasn’t afraid of bullets. He’d lived through gunfights, betrayals, freezing mountains, and burning towns. But what he didn’t expect—what he couldn’t fight off with a gun—was the sickness growing inside him.

It started with a cough. Just a bit of blood, maybe from riding too hard, he told himself. But deep down, he knew something was wrong. Days passed. The coughing got worse, his body weaker. Climbing on a horse felt like dragging himself through mud.

And yet, as his body broke down, something inside him came alive. He started to see things differently. Not just right or wrong—but what mattered. Who he could still help. Who he wanted to be, before the end.

That’s when the music kicks in. As you ride with Arthur through the misty swamps, trying to make peace with the life you’ve lived, [“That’s the Way It Is”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYD84nHBpoI) plays. It’s quiet, almost like the world itself is whispering that nothing lasts forever—and that’s okay.

He wasn’t perfect. He stole, he hurt people. But now, with time running out, he tried to make it right. He helped others escape, gave away money, protected the people who still had a chance. Not because he thought it would save him—but because he wanted to leave the world a little better than he found it.

Even when death was right there, breathing down his neck, Arthur stood tall. That’s what makes [“Unshaken”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0AykH20X3Q) hit so hard. The song isn’t loud. It doesn’t beg for attention. It just... stands still. Like him.

Tuberculosis took Arthur’s body—but it gave him back his soul.
And in the end, that’s the part of him we remember. Not the outlaw. The man.
