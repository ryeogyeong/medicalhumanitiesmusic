# Still Alice

In Still Alice(2014), directed by Richard Glatzer, This music(If I Had a Boat) expresses the finiteness of life with a soft yet lonely tone of the sadness and loneliness of the protagonist who loses her memory.
In the movie Still Alice, the song [*If I Head a Boat*](https://youtu.be/SkFO1qIMeSE?si=oqHzL9WEzVLQ5Gar) plays in a scene where the main character Alice accepts the progression of the disease and enjoys time with her family.
The music gives a warm and comfortable feeling through the soft acoustic guitar performance, which makes listeners understand the comfort Alice feels with her family. And the calm and simple rhythm and melody of this music harmonize with the scene where Alice spends a drowsy time with her family, revealing Alice's calm feelings well.

Example: The same disease is described in Hwan Min Oh's 2021 TV Drama [*Navillera*](yeo_inwook.md) The TV Drama Min Kim's song "My Day" is also a song that depicts the main character's Alzheimer's disease in the TV drama Navillera. My Day expresses the protagonist's willingness to challenge his past dreams in order to regain the memories of the past that are gradually disappearing.

Oasis - whatever: The lyrics of this song convey a message that no matter what you do or say, it's okay, so live freely and don't live just showing what you want people to show. I chose this song because I wanted to convey this message to others. [*Whatever*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad9D41WzkEQ)
