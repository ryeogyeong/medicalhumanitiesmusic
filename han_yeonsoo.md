# We Need to Talk About Kevin

In We Need to Talk About Kevin, Buddy Holly’s ["Everyday"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2Nk-TVuthE) plays during a haunting Halloween night sequence. As Eva drives through dark, rain-soaked streets crowded with children in costumes, the song’s cheerful melody floats over visuals filled with dread: blurred headlights, wet windows, and Eva’s strained, silent expression. The contrast is jarring. The camera closely mirrors her anxious gaze, transforming suburban normalcy into something sinister. We are no longer seeing through the lens of routine life—we are seeing through Eva’s fear.
This ironic pairing of upbeat music with psychological unease reveals the film’s central tension: the disconnect between appearances and reality, between the facade of an ordinary life and the violence hiding underneath. Everyday doesn’t soften the horror—it sharpens it. Instead of comfort, it delivers discomfort. The sweetness of the melody makes Eva’s isolation more painful, and her dread more palpable.
This same use of musical dissonance to expose mental collapse appears in Alban Berg’s 1925 opera [*Wozzeck*](jang_geunyeong.md). In Wozzeck, cheerful folk tunes interrupt scenes of psychological unraveling, creating a chilling sense of alienation. Both works use music not to soothe but to fracture—to open a gap between the outer world and inner suffering, between the everyday and the unspeakable.
“Everyday” thus becomes more than a song—it becomes a mirror. It reflects Eva’s hollow attempt to move through life as usual while everything inside her has broken apart.

Funeral Song: “Happy Together”
I chose ["Happy Together"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSw8an1u3rc) by The Turtles to be played at my funeral—not because it’s sad, but because it isn’t. Its bright melody and sincere lyrics remind me of everything I was grateful for. I didn’t live a perfect life, but I lived a life surrounded by people I loved—and that made me happy.
Fittingly, Happy Together is also the title of my favorite film. Wong Kar-wai’s Happy Together captures what it means to be close, to be estranged, and to miss someone even while standing right beside them. The film taught me that love is rarely simple, and that happiness is often tangled with sadness—but it’s still worth everything.
I want this song to be a parting gift. Not a farewell, but a celebration. A reminder that whatever came before this moment, we were once—truly—happy together.


승현이는 조용한 학생이었다. 고등학교 내내 큰 말썽 없이 성적 잘 받고, 무난하게 착한 사람으로 통했다. 딱히 튀지 않고, 튈 필요도 없었다. 사람들이 기대하는 대로만 움직이면 됐으니까. 대학에 들어가서도 그 태도를 유지하려 했다. 아무 문제 없어 보였고, 그대로 쭉 갈 줄 알았다. 그런데 어느 날부터 이상해졌다. 교수님의 말 한마디가 머릿속에 오래 남았고, 지나가는 사람들 목소리가 자기를 가리키는 것처럼 느껴졌다. 처음엔 기분 탓이라고 생각했다. 하지만 복도 CCTV가 따라다니는 것 같고, 밤에는 창밖 어딘가에서 누가 자신을 보고 있다는 생각이 떠나지 않았다. 방 안에 혼자 있어도 누군가 말 거는 소리가 들렸고, 머릿속에서 생각이 아닌 말들이 흘러나왔다. 시간이 지날수록 그 세계는 점점 더 선명해졌고, 자기 삶은 어디까지가 현실이고 어디부터가 환상인지 알 수 없게 되었다. 말을 꺼내자니 이상한 사람 될 것 같고, 말을 삼키자니 자신이 점점 사라지는 기분이었다.
