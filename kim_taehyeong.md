# Malaton(말아톤)

Cho-won is an autistic disabled person who looks normal on the surface, but his mental age remains at five. His mother, Kyung-sook, discovers that Cho has a special ability to run and trains her son devotedly to completing the full course of the marathon. Meanwhile, Jung-wook, a former marathoner who came to community service by driving under the influence, takes Cho-won's coach. However, the training process for the marathon is not smooth. Cho-won's unpredictable behavior and Kyung-sook's blind passion have caused conflicts. In particular, Cho-won's younger brother expresses dissatisfaction with his mother's all-interest and effort toward his brother, and family conflicts are sometimes exposed to the surface. Despite these difficulties, Cho-won runs silently and finds his own rhythm. Finally, Cho-won completes the marathon, through which Cho and his family understand each other and grow up.

[This song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nM9hL95LzA) reflects the regular and repetitive lifestyle of the main character, and describes the disconnection from the world that autism creates. The fast and cheerful rhythm represents the constant effort and independence of the main character, and at the same time emphasizes that his world is a detailed and solitary space. Through the act of marathon, Cho-won attempts to connect with the world in his own way, but in the process, his solitude and the complexity of his inner world are contained in this music. The music serves to emphasize that his emotions are not well communicated with the outside world, but that they are constantly moving inside. In the Chuncheon Marathon, the most important moment of the movie, "Run Cho-won" flows out to the climax in the scene where Cho-won unleashes his last energy toward the finish line. Cho-won is already in a situation where he is exhausted and has a hard time keeping his body properly, but he is persistent toward his goal of "Sub Three (completed within three hours). With many athletes around him giving up and flopping down, only Cho-won silently continues his fight with him. At this time, "Run Cho-won" goes beyond just cheering songs, and explosively expresses his strong will to wriggle inside and pure desire to break the world's walls.

Similarly, schizophrenia, classified as ICD 6A, is described in the 2014 drama [*It's Okay, That's Love*](do_gwanwoo.md) by Noh Heekyung, sung by singer Davichi, in a song with the same name as the drama.

# 장송곡
[Butter-Fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-2T-JnXEr8&t=5s)

내 장례식에 와준 소중한 사람들이 듣는 곡인 만큼 그들에게 힘이 되어줄 수 있는 노래가 흘러나온다면 좋을 것 같고, 우리 세대는 어느 정도 다 알 수 있는 노래라고 생각해서 Butter-Fly를 선택하게 되었습니다. 일본 노래지만 사람들이 저의 장례식이면 한국인이 전부일테니 모두가 알아들을 수 있는 한국어 번안 버전을 선택했습니다.
