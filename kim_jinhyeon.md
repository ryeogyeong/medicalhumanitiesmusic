# La Peste
In the 1940s, when World War II was in full swing, a sudden plague broke out in Oran, a small city on the northern coast of French Algeria, and the city of Orang was cut off from the outside and citizens were isolated accordingly. It philosophically dealt with the existence of human beings, which is revealed as the curtain continues for a year, with dozens or hundreds of people dying a day while isolated from the outside.

[It shows what choices](https://youtu.be/1Rw7p8McXzw?feature=shared), humans make in the face of the inevitable catastrophic fate that is facing everyone, centering on the protagonist, Dr. Li and Health University. Not only is it a representative work of existentialist literature, but it is also the beginning of the disaster novel genre in public.

The film adaptation’s theme song, “Psalmus Ode,” intensifies this sense of spiritual and emotional turmoil. Through its haunting choral progression and somber orchestration, the piece reflects the sacred silence of collective grief and the spiritual vacuum left by the plague. It is used in key scenes not merely to underscore sadness but to elevate the silent, resilient dignity of people confronting suffering without answers.

The music avoids melodrama, instead echoing the existential tone of the novel—it does not portray illness as punishment or tragedy, but as a condition that reveals our shared vulnerability. Through the combination of image, story, and sound, The Plague delivers a powerful reflection on disease and disability—not as individual misfortune, but as a universal, inescapable part of being human.

Example : The similiar disease is described in Suran's 2024 sing.[*Erotic Joke*](yum_jihyeon.md) , Aids.

# 장례식에서 연주되길 희망하는 음악
영화 코코의 OST인 Remember Me 라는 음악이 연주되는 것을 원합니다. 이 노래는 영화 코코의 사운드 트랙으로써 가사 내에서 나를 기억해줘, 헤어진다고 해서 울지 말렴과 같은 작별인사를 통해 이별하는 과정을 나타내고 있습니다. 
코코라는 영화 자체가 내포하는 이별이라는 단어를 노래를 통해 다시한번 나타낼 수 있도록 하였는데, 이를 통해 이별이라는 것에 대해 음악을 통해 연결지을 수 있다고 생각하여 이러한 노래가 연주되었으면 하는 생각이었습니다.
