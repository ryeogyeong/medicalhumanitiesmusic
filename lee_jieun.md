# La Traviata

In particular, the music played at the moment of Violeta's death, the last scene, is very important. Act 3's aria [*Addio del Passato*](https://youtu.be/ug9gWXlyuDs?si=CCD_NZuu_2-vWA8U) ("Barewell to the Past") expresses the scene of Violeta recognizing her imminent death and saying goodbye to loneliness in music.

In "La Traviata", music expresses the disease of tuberculosis in Violletta as a core of her emotions and humanity, rather than just a background setting. Especially in "Addio del Passato", it expresses the weakened body of Violletta and the fading flame of life through a soft and increasingly weak melody. The slow and thin melody implies inner peace as she prepares to leave the world, but at the same time dramatically highlights the transience of human existence and the despair caused by disease. Music goes beyond mere description and conveys to the audience the loneliness, regret, and obsession of love felt by Violeta. In *La Traviata*, “Addio del passato” is sung by Violetta as she lies on her deathbed, bidding farewell to her past love and life. The music begins delicately and quietly, reflecting her weakened state and emotional resignation. The stage is typically set as a dimly lit sickroom, with Violetta seated, holding a letter or gazing out the window. As the aria progresses, she gradually reveals her suffering—trembling, leaning against the bed, or breaking down in emotion. Her gestures and expressions, combined with the restrained staging, harmonize with the music to portray a poignant farewell and a calm acceptance of death.

A disease called hearing impairment is depicted in a movie called [*Coda*](han_gahyeon.md). Pulmonary tuberculosis and hearing impairment are not directly related, but hearing impairment is a type of hearing loss and aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as one of the treatments for streptomycin Tuberculosis, can induce this ototoxicity and cause hearing loss. In "Coda", a music-loving girl navigates her identity between the hearing world and her deaf family, using music as a bridge to connect with herself and others. In contrast, La Traviata presents Violetta, who, facing death from tuberculosis, expresses her final emotions through music as a farewell to life. Both works center around how music persists amid physical loss or deterioration—be it hearing impairment or failing lungs—as a means of self-expression, emotional release, and human connection. Notably, tuberculosis treatments such as streptomycin can cause hearing loss, suggesting that Violetta, too, may have been losing her access to sound, drawing a parallel to the silent world in CODA. In both narratives, even in the absence or distortion of sound, music remains present—an intangible yet powerful conduit for love, suffering, and the essence of being human.

In her final moments in La Traviata, Violetta uses music to express her profound loneliness and the sorrow of saying goodbye. The aria “Addio, del passato” conveys her emotional and physical decline through its slow tempo and subdued melody. The music reflects her isolation, resignation, and fading hope, becoming a powerful vehicle for her inner voice. Rather than merely accompanying the drama, the music itself becomes her final confession — a poignant farewell to love, life, and the world.

# 나의 장례식에 연주되길 희망하는 음악
[*Kim Kwang Seok - Around Thirty*](https://youtu.be/L7lED8RtdAI?si=0DfPIXpvuOYhTzOv)

I hope "Around Thirty" by Kim Kwang-Seok will be played at my funeral. This song is more than just a reflection on youth or aging — it captures the emotional journey of growth, loss, and introspection that we all experience as time inevitably passes. Everyone, at some point, looks back and wonders, “Why did that moment hurt so much? Why was I so thrilled back then?” This song embraces those quiet questions with poignant honesty. The opening line, “Another day drifts away, like a puff of cigarette smoke,” is both poetic and direct in conveying the passage of time. Life fades gradually, just like that. I, too, lived my life step by step, letting go of people I loved, moving through countless emotions. All those moments feel distilled in this one song. I want this piece to be played at my funeral because, even when my life has ended, I want the music to speak for me. This song tells the story of how I lived, what I felt, and what I thought — not through grand declarations, but through a simple melody and honest lyrics. If those gathered in grief can listen to this song and remember me — and perhaps reflect on their own lives for a moment — then I believe the song has done something meaningful. Moreover, Kim Kwang-Seok’s voice carries comfort. He sings of sorrow without being consumed by it, and his calm, steady tone suggests that sadness can be carried without being overwhelmed. I believe that voice can offer a gentle peace to those I leave behind.

# 나의 질환서사: 새로운 환경 적응 중 발생한 불면

고등학교 시절, 처음 기숙사 생활을 경험하면서 환경 변화, 적응으로 인해 불면증이 생겼습니다. 초기에는 불규칙한 수면시간, 잦은 각성 등의 증상이 지속되었으며, 이로 인해 낮 동안 피로, 집중력 저하, 감정 기복이 동반되었습니다. 문제 해결을 위해 취침 전 전자기기 사용 제한, 카페인 섭취 조절, 수면 유도 음악 및 명상 활용, 규칙적인 일과 유지 등의 생활습관 개선을 시도하였고, 점차 수면의 질이 향상되었습니다. 무엇보다 규칙적인 생활과 취미 생활은 새로운 환경에서 적응하고 생활하는데 큰 도움이 되었습니다. 그 시절 제게 위안과 안정을 건네준 곡들이 아직까지 제 곁을 잔향처럼 맴돌고 있습니다. 자기 전 항상 들었던 [*플레이리스트*](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5lTPIpcjpft6A-Zj8fkq3BRINckMC_cL&si=JxEoAOWZpNg_AESq) 입니다.
