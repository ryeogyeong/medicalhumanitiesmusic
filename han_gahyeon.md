# coda

In CODA, the family members are deaf, and only the main character, Ruby, can hear. [In the scene where Ruby sings on stage using sign language for her family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgKvP0O0nyI), the film turns off the sound, letting the audience experience the silent world her family lives in. By doing this, music becomes a bridge that helps people understand and connect with a different world. It shows that disability is not just a limit to overcome, but a different way of living. This perspective has inspired empathy and respect toward those who live with disabilities.

A film that deals with the same hearing impairment. In the film [*A Silent Voice*](jin_guangxin.md), the main character has a hearing impairment that gradually worsens. In contrast, in the film CODA, it is the protagonist’s family—excluding the protagonist herself—that has hearing impairments. This difference can be seen as a key distinction between the two films.

The song I hope to be played at my funeral is [Love Poem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcVmaIlHZ1o) by IU. She's my favorite singer, and this song gave me strength during my school years when I felt tired and worn out. One line in the lyrics, 'Behind you, who walks alone, this song that won’t stop,' was especially comforting to me
